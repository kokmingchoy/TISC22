The RPG game is a text-based client-server game with a "sword and sorcery" theme.
The basic premise is that you have to fight with a "boss" creature and reduce its HP (Hit Points) below 0 before it does the same to you.
Your HP starts at 10 points and may be restored midway through a boss fight by taking healing potions.
You can deal more damage if you purchase a sword.
Both Potions and Sword have to be purchased with Gold, which is obtained through mining.
Unfortunately, whenever mining is undertaken, there is a (20%) chance of dying through an encounter with a "creeper".

Fighting the first boss creature - Slime - is fairly trivial as it has a HP of 5 and if you had bought a Sword, you can finish it off in 2 rounds of attack.

Fighting the second boss creature - Wolf (HP 30 / Attack 3) - is a bit more challenging but still doable as long as you have enough Potions.

The final boss creature - Dragon (HP 100 / Attack 50) - is impossible to beat because after the first round of attack or use of Potion, its attack will instantly kill you (since you only have a maximum HP of 10).
