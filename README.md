# TISC22
This is my write-up for **The InfoSecurity Challenge (TISC) 2022** by the Center for Strategic Technologies (CSIT).

I came in at 104th position in a field of 730 players, after having completed Levels 1 through 3 and attempted Level 4B.

I took part in last year's TISC 2021 (see my [write-up](https://github.com/kokmingchoy/TISC21)) and this year's Challenge was just as fun.
